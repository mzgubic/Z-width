# Z-width
Number of light neutrinos changes the total width of the Z boson, hence from its resonance shape the number of light neutrino species can be determined. The plot that is usually shown in the discussion however contains an unexpected detail: it appears that the width of the Z decreases with the number of neutrino species.
